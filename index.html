            with their commute destinations. New state-to-state migration data from the

            reveals that some movers went so far as to move across state lines.
          </p>
          <p>
            An uptick in interstate movement shown by results from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs">American Community Survey</a>
            contradicts trends from prior years. But the pandemic, combined with certain characteristics of popular states,
            proved sufficient to motivate many Americans to find new states to call home.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Despite long-term decline in changing residence, 2021 saw more people moving across state lines than in previous years
          </h2>
          <p>
            Since [year] the number of Americans moving to new residences has declined, down [percent] in [year]. But the number of people specifically moving between 
            states does not follow the same trend.
          </p>
          <p>
            After increasing steadily from 2010 to 2015, the number of people moving across state lines began to plateau and even decreased slightly in 2019. But after
            a lapse in data collection in the pandemic's first year, 2021 numbers showed significantly more people moving across state lanes than in 2019. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In the year before the pandemic, 17.4% of people who moved homes in the U.S. crossed state lines. In 2021, that number jumped to 19.4% of movers.

            It's possible that the prevelance of remote work during the pandemic pushed people across state borders. According to the 
            <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022/people-working-from-home.html">U.S. Census</a>, three times as 
            many people reported working from home in 2021 than in 2019 â€” meaning three times as many people were free to clock in from 
            a home in the state of their choosing.

          <h2>
            States with warm weather and low prices attracted new residents in 2021
          </h2>
          <p>
            Which state a remote worker might choose for their new home may vary from person to person. But state migration data shows that warmer states with low costs of living 
            were especially appealing to those crossing state lines in 2021.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of all 50 states, Florida attracted the most out-of-staters. More populous states are likely to have larger influxes of movers, but Florida remains on top when
            it comes to net flow of movers, or how many more people are moving into a state than moving out. Other states with high net flows of newcomers include Texas,
            North Carolina, Arizona and South Carolina.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of these states are in the southern half of the U.S. and may have warmer climates than some of their northern neighbors, which could have been a draw for new residents.
          </p>
          <p>
            With long-distance moves, climate is not the only aspect of day-to-day life that is likely to change. Daily expendatures, from groceries to transportation, vary
            in price from state to state. In 2021, states with lower costs of living tended to have higher net flows of movers. More expensive states saw lower net flows.

          <p>
            States with the lowest net flows include California, New York, Illinois, Massachuessets and New Jersey. With the exception of California, these states tend to be 
            colder than those with high net flows. Although these states had median costs of living in 2021, some of their most populous cities bore the

                In 2021, for the first time since the American Community Survey started reporting on state-to-state migration in 2005, Connecticut had a positive net flow.  
              </p>
              <p>
                This sudden change in Connecticut's migration patterns could be due to its close proximity to New York City. People were already moving out of cities before the pandemic. The opportunity to ditch metropolitan offices and hefty housing prices 
                <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/03/domestic-migration-trends-shifted.html">accelerated this trend</a> from 2020 to 2022.
