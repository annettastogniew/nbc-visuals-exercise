          <h2>
            Despite long-term decline in changing residence, 2021 saw more people moving across state lines than in previous years
          </h2>
          <p>
            Since [year] the number of Americans moving to new residences has declined, down [percent] in [year]. But the number of people specifically moving between 
            states does not follow the same trend.
          </p>
          <p>
            After increasing steadily from 2010 to 2015, the number of people moving across state lines began to plateau and even decreased slightly in 2019. But in 2020, the pandemic forced most Americans to set up home workspaces and cut ties with
            physical offices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remote work persisted beyond the onset of the pandemic. According to the <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022/people-working-from-home.html">U.S. Census</a>, 17.9% of people in the U.S. 
            reported working from home in 2021 â€” three times as many as in 2019. As Covid restrictions loosened in some states, the so-called "digital nomad" was born. Free from a designated workspace, remote workers looking for a change of scenery
            may explain have led the sudden increase of interstate movers in 2021.
